# PhospoproteomicsAnalysis
This is the code used to analyze data in the paper "Bimodal evolution of Src and Abl kinase substrate specificity revealed using mammalian cell extract as substrate pool" by Patrick Finneran et al.


Running "PhosphoPeptide Analysis Script.py" will generate figures found in the manuscript. After running the python script running "Generate Sequence Logos.R" will generate the sequence logos found above the heatmaps for certain figures.


Required Modules:
